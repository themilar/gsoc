## Introduction 

Hi Folks :rocket:,

I'm Sudarsan :blush: from the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. I'm really passionate about building web applications using Django Rest Framework and ReactJS, which are some of my favorite tools in my developer toolbox. I'm also really comfortable with Java, JavaScript, and Python, and I'm excited to keep learning and growing as a developer.

I'm fairly new to the open-source world, but I'm eager to dive in and start contributing to projects that can make a positive impact. That's why I'm really excited about the opportunity to work with Wagtail in the Google Summer of Code program. I think Wagtail is an awesome content management system, and I'm excited to learn more about it and help make it even better.

Overall, I'm just a curious and motivated developer who loves to tackle new challenges and build cool stuff. Thanks for taking the time to get to know me a bit better...!

## Tasks

#### Checklist: Google Summer of Code

This is the first checklist for candidates to go through. It’s a good idea to start early, so you can get to know the community and the project.

- [x] Watch the official [‘Introduction to GSoC’ video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD2tChhrWM&feature=youtu.be).
- [x] Read [Advise for People Applying for GSoC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-advice).
- [x] Read all of Google’s [contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/)
- [x] Read the official [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and add the most important dates as reminders on your calendar.

You’ve done the hardest bits! Now all that’s left is for you to:

- [x] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/discussions/1) discussion thread.

### Checklist: open source contributions

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [x] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).
- [x] Clone this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHub’s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [x] Your GitHub profile
  - [x] Your Twitter profile if any
  - [ ] Your Mastodown profile if any
  - [x] Your LinkedIn profile if any
  - [ ] Your personal website
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your participant file, and copy-paste our contributor guide’s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

### Checklist: interest in learning
- [ ] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific GSoC project idea you’re interested in.
- [ ] Go through our projects under the [wagtail organisation](https://github.com/wagtail) in GitHub. Create a new list with links to repositories or specific issues you would be interested in contributing to during the internship.
- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things you’ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 6 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).


### Checklist: Django and Wagtail
