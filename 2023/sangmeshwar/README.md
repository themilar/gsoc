## Introduction

Hey everyone!
My name is Sangmeshwar Mahajan. I am pursuing undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering. I am from Pune. I like designing good user interfaces. Also, I am passionate about improving user experience and find new innovative ideas.
As a open source contributor I have experience of doing contribution in Hacktoberfest'22. But it's my first attempt in GSoC. As a open source contributor, I liked your project [#dark-theme-for-wagtail-admin](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2023#dark-theme-for-wagtail-admin). It's just raised my instinct of development in your project.
Here is my [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahajan-sangmeshwar/) profile link.
