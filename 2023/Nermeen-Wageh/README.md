## Introduction

Hello everyone! 
My name is [Nermeen Wageh](https://github.com/nermeenwageh10), and I am an Egyptian woman I live in Madrid, I studied computer science years ago,I have been away from the workforce for the past three years while on maternity leave, but during that time I have remained dedicated to staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field of software engineering. I started problem-solving one year ago and solved more than 350 problems on leetcode and taught people programming on LinkedIn and made a group to help them  progress quickly on problem-solving and make a personal project to hone my skills and keep my knowledge current.

Before my maternity leave, I worked as a software engineer at Coderoots for two years ,where I gained extensive experience in Rest APIs,and I am eager to bring my passion for software engineering to GSOC.

As a newcomer to the world of open-source software, I am thrilled to have been given the opportunity to participate in GSOC with the Wagtail project. The prospect of working alongside talented developers and experienced mentors to create something that will make a positive impact on the world is truly exhilarating.

With my technical skills in Python, Django, and JavaScript, my keen attention to detail, and my ability to work collaboratively with others, I believe that I can make a valuable contribution to the Wagtail project. I am passionate about learning from experienced mentors, collaborating with other contributors, and making a real difference in the open-source community.

Participating in Google Summer of Code with Wagtail will provide me with the chance to gain valuable experience, hone my technical skills, and make meaningful contributions to a project that I am passionate about. I am excited to join the Wagtail community, work on challenging projects, and help to make a positive impact in the world of open-source software.
