## **Introduction**

Thanks for giving us the opportunity to introduce ourselves. üôè

Hello Everyone!! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" height="18px">

I'm [**Sobhan Bera**](https://sobhanbera.github.io), and I am a Public Speaker and Developer based in India with a strong passion for **Web** and **Android** development, as well as **DevOps**. With extensive experience in using **ReactJS** and **React-Native** for software development and **Flask** for building backends, I am always eager to learn new technologies and share my knowledge with others.

I am excited to apply for the Google Summer of Code program to contribute to the **Wagtail CMS community**. I have been using Python for 2 years and I am familiar with web development frameworks such as Django and **Flask**. I have also worked with various CMS platforms, both open-source and commercial, and I find Wagtail to be one of the most promising and user-friendly options available.

As a developer, I am passionate about creating high-quality software that solves real-world problems and benefits users. I believe that **Wagtail CMS** is an excellent example of such software, as it empowers content creators and developers to collaborate effectively and produce dynamic, responsive websites with ease. I am motivated to contribute to Wagtail because I want to help make it even better, by adding new features, improving existing ones, fixing bugs, and enhancing the user experience.

I am also eager to learn more about Wagtail's architecture and best practices, and to collaborate with the community to deliver high-quality code that meets the project's standards.

I will be glad to connect with you guys on [**Linkedin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sobhanbera) ‚ú®

## **Research**

These are few projects which gives a reference of my knowledge in this domain.

-   Recently, I've been engaged in researching a method for converting various data formats to others. Although this process may have already been implemented by others, I have decided to undertake it myself from the ground up. You can find the Rust library I've created at https://github.com/sobhanbera/vidify.
-   Previous to this I have also created a voice bot/assistant in Python that understands human voice and controls an android application based on commands.

Thanks for taking the time to read this...
